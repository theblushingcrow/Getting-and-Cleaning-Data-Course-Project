* General info on the experiment: 



The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has 

been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the 

test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width 

sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and 

body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational 

force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each 

window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

Check the README.txt file in the raw data zip for further details about this dataset. 



The resulting tidy dataset has 81 columns. These are: 

[1] subject - a number identifying the subject. 


[2] activity - A string describing the nature of the activity measured. In total, 6 activities were measured for each sunject: 

walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying. 



The additional 79 variables are the average of measurements takes for each specific subject/activity combination. Each of the values used are either a mean value or a standard deviation value. All values are normalized and bounded within [-1,1] (the original units are not given in the raw data).
